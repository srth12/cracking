c++ study material:

1. dynamic allocation of memory:
  int* a=new int;
  allocating memory and initialising by:
  char* ptr=new char('a');
  float* fpt=new float(1.23);
  for array:
    int* a=new int[10];
    
 2. dynamic deallocation of memory by:
   delete ptr;
   for array of size 10:
   delete[10] ptr; or delete[] ptr;
   
   for multidimentional array:
   pt=new int[3][4]...
    note: for multidimentional array only 1-D can be variable or constants, rest should be constants.
   
3. c++ treats strings as char array,
   char name[]="pointer";
   
   - we can also create strings using array of pointers:
      char * name[]={"sachin","tendulkar","sarath"};
      
   -to retrive the names call name[1] ...
  
 4. Pointers and functions:
   a. call by value
   b. calll by reference
  -call  by reference used in 2 ways : 
    1. by passing the reference (alias name for the original)
       float value= 12.3
       float & amt=value; //amt reference to value
       
       so, 
       cout<<value; is same as cout<<amt;
       
       note: reference may be passed only for variables not for constants
       
    2. by passing the pointer:
        float value=12.3;
        float *fp=&value;
        
        then, cout<<*fp;
        
        ex:
        void swap(int &a,int &b){
        
        int temp;
        temp=a;
        a=b;
        b=temp;
        }
        int main(){
        
        int a=3,b=4;
        swap(a,b);
        cout<<a<<b;
        }
        
  5. dynamically creating structures:
    
    Employee* emp;
    emp=new Employee;
    
    delete emp;      
  6. passing objects through call by value
       a called function receiving an object as a parameter creates the copy of the object without
       invoking the constructor. However when the fn terminates it  destroy the copy of the object
       by invoking the destructor.
