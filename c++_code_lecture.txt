c++ study material:

1. dynamic allocation of memory:
  int* a=new int;
  allocating memory and initialising by:
  char* ptr=new char('a');
  float* fpt=new float(1.23);
  for array:
    int* a=new int[10];
    
 2. dynamic deallocation of memory by:
   delete ptr;
   for array of size 10:
   delete[10] ptr;
   
3. c++ treats strings as char array,
   char name[]="pointer";
   
   - we can also create strings using array of pointers:
      char * name[]={"sachin","tendulkar","sarath"};
      
   -to retrive the names call name[1] ...
